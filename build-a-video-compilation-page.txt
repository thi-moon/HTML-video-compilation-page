        <h1>My Top 3 Eve Music Videos</h1>
        <p>Popular Japanese singer-songwriter and producer Eve has recently gotten more recognition due to making intros of popular media like Jujustsu Kaisen. I've been a fan of his work for over 2 years, and these are my favorite songs made by him!</p>

            <h2>Avant - Eve Music Video</h2>
            <p>Following the success of Kaikai Kitan, the opening music to the previously mentioned Jujutsu Kaisen anime, Avant has the same elements and visuals that are found in Kaikai Kitan, and was even used for an official Jujutsu Kaisen game, making for a really good listen, especially if you're already a fan of the series!</p>

            <h2>We're Still Underground - Eve Music Video</h2>
            <p>This music video is not only a song, but a whole story in 5 minutes! With it's breathtaking animation and beatiful song and vocals, it makes for a wonderful and emotional listen. Note that even if you don't understand Japanese, this song (and many other popular music videos) has personalized English captions that add onto the experience for many!</p>
